# task_tracker_cli
https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker

Made the task tracker CLI from roadmap.sh! this is my first fully finished program in python ever so i'm super excited I was able to finish it without much help or guidance from anyone!

The program uses numbers to select options given and user input to create, update and remove tasks.

The only python libraries used are json and datetime.

It uses taskapp_storage.json in the same directory as the python script to store and manage the tasks data.

Cheers! :)
